This script eases development of vim scripts that use embedded perl code by automatically checking the embedded perl code for compile-time errors when the scripts are saved.

So if you save a file with a syntax error you will get a message something like this:

     :!~/.vim/syntax_check_embedded_perl.perl /some/file.vim /tmp/BjPcoMnIoe
     Global symbol "$syn_error_var" requires explicit package name at /some/file.vim line 42.
     BEGIN not safe after errors--compilation aborted at /some/file.vim line 46.
     
     /some/file.vim has embedded perl compilation errors.  The file has been saved anyway, but a copy of the old (pre-save) version of the file is available in /tmp/BjPcoMnIoe
     
     shell returned 1

     Press ENTER or type command to continue

This supports a style of programming where source files are kept  with
valid syntax.  This is a particularly useful approach when embedding perl
in vim as error propagation up through vim can get a bit wild.

run-time error diagnostics.
